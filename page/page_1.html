				<h3>WE ARE ANIMAL</h3>
				<p>The Giant loves the Rhino. We’re practically related. They’re our sisters from other misters.
					Our brothers from other mothers. They’re a wild crew of animals that make kickass videos for
					companies ranging from local Chattanooga startups to globally recognized brands like Nike &
					Samsung, & we’ve spent the last few years working side-by-side to help build their brand.

				<p>The main archives of the Congregation are located in London, Ontario, and there are neighborhood
					archives in Hamilton, London, Peterborough and Pembroke. Highlights of the archives include records
					related to the many hospitals built by the Sisters across Ontario and western Canada. Other notable
					records include those of St. Mary’s Orphanage in Hamilton, Mount St. Joseph Orphanage in London,
					St. Vincent’s Orphanage in Peterborough, and St. Joseph’s Orphanage in Cobourg.
				</p>
				<p>Also featured are records relating to Mount St. Joseph Academy in London and the Teacher’s College
					in Chapeau, Quebec. The records found in each archives document programs implemented by the Sisters
					for the poor, refugees, the elderly, and women in need, among others. The archives, which keep priceless
					photographs, manuscripts, artifacts, artwork and multimedia, are a rich source of history related to
					religious life, education, healthcare, and social justice in Canada, and a treasure trove for genealogists.
				</p>
				<p>Summer is almost here and we are waiting for that time of the year when we can cook outdoors,
					eat cherries at its best and enjoy a family meal until late in the day. To celebrate the joy
					for the coming season, our team has curated a gallery with some great photos of food and summertime
					moments. Be sure to check out the whole gallery on Flickr and feel free to add your own favorite
					pictures in the comments section.

				<p>Custom birthday party invitations are all the rage these days. More and more you see pins
					and posts of homemade invitations that look like they were done by talented professionals,
					and you may be thinking “I’m just not creative enough to make something like that”. Or, wondering
					how people find the time to do such elaborate projects. You would be surprised how quickly and
					easily you can create a set of birthday party invitations, along with matching decorations, tags
					and cards that make other people say WOW!
