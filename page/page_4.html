				<h3>WELCOME TO THE KINGDOM</h3>
				<p>Whatever happens, we stick close. As a full team we spend quality time getting to know each other.
					Through smaller militias we attack problems head-on and knock them out. People know Rhinos as a
					tight-knit crew. There's a glint in our eye when we walk into a place that startles the bravest
					of men and the comeliest of women. That's because we're out of the cage. We are the music
					makers and we are the dreamers of dreams. We are animal.
				</p>

				<p>Our mission isn't bound to a product or service. It could be anything and everything that the community
					loves. We will be defined by the intelligent and talented and badass people we draw into our orbit and the
					scope of their vision. The recruitment of artists and leaders is therefore the most important thing we do.
					We're convinced that a multi-billion-dollar international conglomerate led by true creatives can do a hell
					of a lot more toward local community building than a ragtag crew of starving artists or a soulless
					Forbes 500 company.
