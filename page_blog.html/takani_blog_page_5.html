				<h3>THE DO'S</h3></a>
				<p>When Patty Maher was a seventh grade student, her art teacher advised her to stop pursuing art in
					school because she had “no real artistic talent.” Today, this Canadian photographer has more than
					eight thousand followers on Flickr and a strong portfolio of self-portrait and fine-art photography.

				<p>She discovered this passion five years ago, while building a list of things in life she should try.
					“Photography was the second thing on the list. The first was collage making,” she said. “As it turns
					out, I’m not a great collage maker. Once I got to photography, I fell in love and never made it to the rest of the list.”
					Patty’s surreal compositions are inspired by different stories; some come from well-known pieces of
					literature and others are inspired by real-life. “Many of the ideas for my photos come from things that
					happen to me in life, or things that I hear about happening to other people… then I take whatever part
					I’m caught by and try and give it a bit of surreal spin,” she said.
					</p>
				<p>Part of the secret to Patty’s unique work is the importance she gives to details. The costumes,
					the colors, the movements are all areas of intense focus for her. “I think they really make or
					break a photo so I spend a good amount of time planning them out,” she explained. Although she
					is the one in charge of doing all the styling, she credits the Canadian second-hand store Value
					Village for most of the wardrobe she uses in her shots.
					</p>
				<p>
					She also mentions her husband: “He is also a photographer and has a great eye for detail so I show
					him my photos when I get close to the final edit and he is excellent at spotting things that could
					use a final tweak.”
					</p>
				<p>
					When taking a photo, Patty works with different versions of her initial idea. “I almost always speed
					shoot because I like the subtleties that can be captured with movement, and I often take hundreds
					of shots in a session,” she said. Post-processing is work that can take her from minutes to hours,
					but she says she always likes to leave the results settle for a day or two before making the final edits.
