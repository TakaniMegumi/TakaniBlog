				<h3>SUN WENDY RAIN</h3>
				<p>My interest in photography stems from many years of underwater photography.
					In recent years I have taken my sea legs to terra firma and have applied my underwater
					passions to all birds of a feather and all of Gods creatures which find themselves within...

				<p>We do our work every day to bring hidden stories to light. This is what we call working in the
					jungle, where the wild things are. The best stories hide out of the main light, in the shadow
					somewhere. We work in this space. It may mean working for poor people, for people that aren't like
					the ones we grew up with, or for efforts that may seem like they don't have any real payoff.
					They do. We believe in the power of the 3, the 12, and the 120. This is an age-old rule that
					says that movements go from small to great by way of distinctly-sized groups. 3 people can move
					fast together. 12 can attack a lot more. 120 is a community with staying power. Move within these
					sizes and watch what happens to the world around you.
					</p>
				<p>Whatever happens, we stick close. As a full team we spend quality time getting to know each other.
					Through smaller militias we attack problems head-on and knock them out. People know Rhinos as a
					tight-knit crew. There's a glint in our eye when we walk into a place that startles the bravest
					of men and the comeliest of women. That's because we're out of the f*&cking cage. We are the music
					makers and we are the dreamers of dreams. We are animal.
