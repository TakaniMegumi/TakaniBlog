				<h3>WE ARE HERE TO BUILD THE BEST CREATIVE COMMUNITY IN THE WORLD</h3>
				<p>A community is a place and a people knit together by a common love. Love is at the center.
					Someone great once said, "If you ain't got love, you ain't got shit." We live by this mantra.
					We got no time for assholes, ladder climbers or loners. We love our community, we love each other,
					and we love the work we do. That love isn't fluffy but hard and specific. Heart bleeds through in every product.
					Creative means that the work we do is of the creative variety. We are artists and craftsmen.
					There are no assembly line workers. Whether we are drafting a logo, shooting a commercial or
					writing a TV show, we do it in a fresh way that gets the people on their feet.
				</p>

				<p>Best means we don't have time for second-rate. We are the Spartans of the art world. Competition
					is in our blood. The world is spinning faster than ever and we gotta move ahead of it. We are up
					on the up and up and down with the latest and we are aiming at the very best.
				</p>
				<p>Our mission isn't bound to a product or service. It could be anything and everything that the
					community loves. We will be defined by the intelligent and talented and badass people we draw into
					our orbit and the scope of their vision. The recruitment of artists and leaders is therefore the most
					important thing we do. We're convinced that a multi-billion-dollar international conglomerate led
					by true creatives can do a hell of a lot more toward local community building than a ragtag crew
					of starving artists or a soulless Forbes 500 company.
